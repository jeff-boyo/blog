# simple blog app

Created for the [*Getting Started Guide*](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) from [*rubyonrails.org*](http://rubyonrails.org)

Almost all of the commits on this repo were me trying to manually convert Blog to postgreSQL from Sqlite3.
All of those changes were subsequently reversed, so the app is as described in the original tutorial.
Instead, I am rebuilding the app with postgreSQL from the start. See [*jeff-boyo/blog_pg*](http://github.com/jeff-boyo/blog_pg).
